'''Suppose you are given two sets of n points, one set {p1, p2, . . . , pn} on the line y = 0 and the
other set {q1, q2, . . . , qn} on the line y = 1. Suppose, p1 路 x < p2 路 x < . . . < pn 路 x (where pi 路 x
is the X-coordinate of pi). Create a set of n line segments by connecting each point pi to the
corresponding point qi. Suppose no three line segments intersect in a point.'''
